Goal & Language
____________
This project uses react js, a language I'm fairly new to and learning much about. The point of building this web application was so that I could practice my react js and also learn new skills.
-----------------
What I've learned
____________
Some of the noticable feats I've accomplished while making this project is learning the CRUD method, where you can create, read, update and delete data from databases. I've learned how to write cleaner codes and structure my folders better, as well as staying consistent in naming folders and files. While making this project, I've gone through trial and error learning new skills and writing more complex code with skills I already use, further refining it. I learned how to use components from Material UI, a really useful website with ready to use components. I called datas from databases and displayed them on my page, where I then added new functionality updating, deleting and creating new data for the database. I learned how to use routes, so that I can make different paths and go through different pages in my web application without having to reload the page.
-----------------
What makes this project special?
____________
This was my first time ever making a full website with many different functionalities, all while using react js. In all my other projects, I've only used standard html, css and js files while here I created a react project and did every unique functionalities using react, as well as using external sources and libraries.
